# A simply minimal programming language for the future

In a world where new hyped language compilers and runtime std libraries are implemented in 4GB of sources, it's time for a reset.

At the foundation is N√Ωr, a portable micro-IR (¬µIR) designed for efficient and flexible code generation across RISC and CISC CPU ISAs. Built on top of N√Ωr is Nova, a new minimal high-level language that embraces modern programming principles. Together, N√Ωr and Nova represent a bold step toward a leaner, more elegant future in software development.
Nava isn't just a language it's a philosophy: that the complexity of modern systems is not a necessity but a choice. Nava chooses minimalism, portability and readability.

# üõ∞Ô∏è Nova Language Syntax Sheet

Nova is a modern simplified C++ with a touch of Lua, designed for clarity and modern expression. It uses `fn` for function declarations, first class multiple return times and omits parentheses for conditional statements, and optional curly braces for single expression functions, too.

```nova
+   -   *   /   %         // arithmetic  
==  !=  <   >   <=  >=    // comparison  
&&  ||  !                 // logical

## üèóÔ∏è Functions

```nova
fn main() {
  print("Hello, " + name)
}
```

*curly braces are optional for single expressions for functions, too*

```nova
fn main()
  print("Hello, " + name)
```

## üîÅ Control Structures

### If/Else

```nova
if x > 0 {
  print("Positive")
} else {
  print("Negative or zero")
}
```

### For (also to be use for while)

```nova
for int i = 0; i < 10; ++i {
  print(i)
}
```

*for iterators and generators, too*           

```nova
for string s = it.next() {
  print(i)
}
```

match color {
  case Red:
    print("Stop")
  case Green:
    print("Go")
  default: 
    print("Wait")
