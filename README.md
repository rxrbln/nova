# A simply minimal programming language for the future

In a world where new hyped language compilers and runtime std libraries are implemented in 4GB of sources, it's time for a reset.

At the foundation is N√Ωr, a portable micro-IR (¬µIR) designed for efficient and flexible code generation across RISC and CISC CPU ISAs. Built on top of N√Ωr is Nova, a new minimal high-level language that embraces modern programming principles. Together, N√Ωr and Nova represent a bold step toward a leaner, more elegant future in software development.
Nava isn't just a language it's a philosophy: that the complexity of modern systems is not a necessity but a choice. Nava chooses minimalism, portability and readability.

# üõ∞Ô∏è Nova Language Syntax Sheet

Nova is a modern simplified C++ with a touch of Lua, designed for clarity and modern expression. It uses `fn` for function declarations, first class multiple return times and omits parentheses for conditional statements, and optional curly braces for single expression functions, too.

## üìÉ Comments

```nova
// Single-line comment

/* 
  Multi-line
  comment 
*/
```

---

## üß† Keywords

```
fn       if       else     for      return
break    continue class    enum     import
typeof   sizeof   match    case     template
try      catch
```

## üî§ Literals

```nova
123         // integer  
3.14        // float  
"hello"     // string  
'c'         // char  
true, false // boolean  
null        // null value
```

---

## üßÆ Operators

```nova
+   -   *   /   %         // arithmetic  
==  !=  <   >   <=  >=    // comparison  
&&  ||  !                 // logical  
&   |   ^   ~   <<  >>    // bitwise
=   +=  -=  *=  /=  ...   // assignment  
```

---

## üèóÔ∏è Functions

```nova
fn main() {
  print("Hello, " + name)
}
```

*curly braces are optional for single expressions for functions, too*

```nova
fn main()
  print("Hello, " + name)
```

---

## üîÅ Control Structures

### If/Else

```nova
if x > 0 {
  print("Positive")
} else {
  print("Negative or zero")
}
```

### For (one one way to loop)

```nova
for int i = 0; i < 10; ++i {
  print(i)
}
```

*for iterators and generators, too*           

```nova
for string s = it.next() {
  print(i)
}
```

---

## üß± Data Structures

Only one way to structure and object-oriented classes.

### Class

```nova
class Vec2 {
  float x,
  i32 y,
}
```

### Enum

```nova
enum Color {
  Red,
  Green,
  Blue,
}
```

---

## üß© Match Expression

```nova
match color {
  case Red:
    print("Stop")
  case Green:
    print("Go")
  default: 
    print("Wait")
}
```

---

## üì¶ Modules

Nova does not use a pre-processor and will find defines from module exports.

```nova
import math

fn main() {
  print(math.sqrt(16))
}
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Exceptions

Nova will support basic exception handling using `throw` and `catch`.

### Throwing an Exception

```nova
fn risky()
  throw "Something went wrong"
```

### Catching Exceptions

```nova
fn main() {
  try
    risky()
  catch err
    print("Error was: " + err)
}
```

You can catch exceptions using a scoped `try`/`catch` block. The error object can be a string or structured data depending on the throw.

---

## üß¨ Generics

Nova will eventually support generics using the `template` keyword before `fn` or `class`.

### Generic Function

```nova
template<T>
fn T identity(T value) {
  return value
}
```

### Generic Class

```nova
template<T>
class Box {
  T value
}
```

Generics allow type-safe, reusable code without sacrificing readability.
