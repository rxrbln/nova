A simply minimal programming language for the future.

In a world where new hyped language compilers and runtime std libraries are implemented in 4GB of sources, it's time for a reset.

At the foundation is Nýr, a portable micro-IR (µIR) designed for efficient and flexible code generation across RISC and CISC CPU ISAs. Built on top of Nýr is Nova, a new minimal high-level language that embraces modern programming principles. Together, Nýr and Nova represent a bold step toward a leaner, more elegant future in software development.
Nava isn't just a language it's a philosophy: that the complexity of modern systems is not a necessity but a choice. Nava chooses minimalism, portability and readability.
